The goal of this project is to study how humans localize the source of sound in three dimensions with only two measurement points. There are several interesting “computations” that the human mind performs in locating the origin of a sound in 3D space, and the literature seems to suggest that localization errors are different for different points in space. Specifically, we hope to utilize phase differences in the audio recorded between two ears, subtle direction-dependent damping characteristics of the ears and any other differentiating artifacts between audio samples that correlate well to position.
